This spring I will be going to the EGU conference in Vienna, Austria.
I will be presenting some of my [recent work](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2016/EGU2016-15179.pdf){:target="_blank"} on the effect of risk awareness on the efficiency of early warning systems for natural disasters.

But that is not all! I am also participating in the EGU Photo Contest with some [pictures](http://imaggeo.egu.eu/user/m.girons/) of my trips. The photo "Living flows" has been selected as one of the finalist images and it will be exhibited during the conference:

![Living flows]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/living_flows.jpg)

There you will be able to vote for it if you like it!
