This year was the first that I attended the EGU General Assembly. At first I was a bit skeptical as I had been told that the conference was so big that it was easy to loose focus and get lost in the frenzy surrounding everything. Also, checking the programme it was clear that it would be impossible to attend all the interesting talks and sessions. This was the state of mind with which I went to Vienna.

After coming back I can say that the conference exceeded my expectations! Apart from the regular sessions - which were very interesting - there was a bunch of outreach, early career, and pedagogic session that made the experience even more enriching. In addition I could talk to a lot of people and get some pretty nice feedback on my poster.

Oh! And I was one of the winners of the [EGU Photo Contest](http://blogs.egu.eu/geolog/2016/04/22/announcing-the-winners-of-the-egu-photo-contest-2016/){:target="_blank"}!
